  <strong>Current release installs directly from CRAN with <code>install.packages("Athlytics")</code>.</strong>
</p>


## Overview

**Athlytics** is a research-oriented R package for the longitudinal analysis of endurance training. It operates entirely on **local [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) exports** (or FIT/TCX/GPX files), avoiding API dependencies to ensure **privacy** and long-term **reproducibility**.

> **What is Strava?** [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) is a popular fitness tracking platform used by millions of athletes worldwide to record and analyze their running, cycling, and other endurance activities. Users can export their complete activity history for offline analysis.

The package standardizes the workflow from data ingestion and quality control to model estimation and uncertainty quantification. Implemented endpoints include **acute-to-chronic workload ratio (ACWR)**, **aerobic efficiency (EF)**, and **cardiovascular decoupling (pa:hr)**, alongside personal-best and exposure profiles suitable for **single-subject** and **cohort** designs. All functions return tidy data, facilitating statistical modeling and figure generation for academic reporting.

## Key Features

* **Reproducible by design** - Fully offline; no API keys. Deterministic pipelines suitable for longitudinal studies.
* **Sports-science metrics** - Implements ACWR, EF, and decoupling workflows commonly used in exercise physiology; integrated **QC** checks.
* **Uncertainty-aware** - Functions return confidence intervals or reference bands where implemented, enabling transparent inference.
* **Cohort support** - Built-in helpers for multi-athlete datasets and percentile-band references.
* **Tidy outputs** - Consistent, analysis-ready tibbles for downstream modeling and figure pipelines.



## 📦 Installation

**Install the current CRAN release**

Athlytics is now available directly from CRAN. For most users, this is the
recommended installation path:

```r
install.packages("Athlytics")
```

The CRAN release includes the offline Strava export workflow, ZIP-aware stream
parsing, ACWR/EWMA/exposure robustness fixes, EF and decoupling stream
diagnostics, cohort-reference helpers, and the rOpenSci review updates.

The source repository, documentation, issue tracker, and rOpenSci review record
are linked from the package metadata and badges above.

### Optional: stream parser support

Athlytics can parse TCX/GPX activity stream files when the suggested `xml2`
package is installed. **FIT support is optional** and uses **FITfileR**, which
is available from the FITfileR r-universe repository.

If your Strava export includes `.fit` files (and you want Athlytics to parse them), install FITfileR:

```r
install.packages(
  "FITfileR",
  repos = c("https://grimbough.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📥 Step 1: Export Your Strava Data

0.  **Important**: Before requesting your export, set Strava language to **English** (Settings → Display Preferences → Language). This helps ensure the exported CSV column names match what Athlytics expects.
1.  Navigate to **[Strava](https://www.strava.com/)** and open Settings → My Account.
2.  Under "Download or Delete Your Account," click **"Get Started"** and then **"Request Your Archive"**.
3.  You'll receive an email with a download link - this may take some time.
4.  Download the ZIP file (e.g., `export_12345678.zip`). As of **1.0.5** the `.zip` can be passed directly to `load_local_activities()`. Stream-based functions can reuse that same ZIP path via `export_dir`: `calculate_pbs()`, `calculate_decoupling()`, and `calculate_ef()` when you want EF to use activity streams for steady-state detection. `calculate_ef()` also falls back to activity-summary averages when `export_dir` is omitted. Unzipping into a directory is still supported and is a reasonable option if you plan to iterate over the export many times.

### 💻 Step 2: Load and Analyze (Cohort Example)

This example shows a common workflow: loading data for several athletes, calculating their training load, and comparing one athlete to the group average.

```r
library(Athlytics)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load data for a cohort of athletes, adding unique IDs
athlete1 <- load_local_activities("path/to/athlete1_export.zip") |> mutate(athlete_id = "A1")
athlete2 <- load_local_activities("path/to/athlete2_export.zip") |> mutate(athlete_id = "A2")
cohort_data <- bind_rows(athlete1, athlete2)

# 2. Calculate ACWR for each athlete in the cohort
cohort_acwr <- cohort_data |>
  group_by(athlete_id) |>
  group_modify(~ calculate_acwr(.x, activity_type = "Run", load_metric = "duration_mins")) |>
  ungroup()

# 3. Generate percentile bands to serve as a reference for the cohort
reference_bands <- calculate_cohort_reference(
  cohort_acwr,
  metric = "acwr_smooth",
  by = character(0),
  min_athletes = 2
)

# 4. Plot an individual's data against the cohort reference bands
individual_acwr <- cohort_acwr |> filter(athlete_id == "A1")
plot_with_reference(individual = individual_acwr, reference = reference_bands)
```



## 📊 Core Analyses

All functions return clean, tidy `tibble` data frames, making it easy to perform your own custom analysis or visualizations.

### Training Load Monitoring (ACWR)

Track how your training load is progressing to avoid ramping up too quickly — a key metric for monitoring training progression.

*[Learn more about ACWR analysis](https://docs.ropensci.org/Athlytics/reference/calculate_acwr.html)*

### Aerobic Efficiency (EF)

See how your aerobic fitness is changing over time by comparing your output (speed or power) to your effort (heart rate). A rising trend is a great sign of improving fitness.

![Efficiency Factor](man/figures/02b_ef_multi_group.png)

When an export ZIP or directory is supplied through `export_dir`, EF uses activity streams for steady-state detection; without it, EF is computed from activity-summary averages.

*[Learn more about Aerobic Efficiency](https://docs.ropensci.org/Athlytics/reference/calculate_ef.html)*

### Cardiovascular Decoupling

Measure your endurance by analyzing how much your heart rate "drifts" upward during a steady-state workout. A low decoupling rate (<5%) is a marker of excellent aerobic conditioning.

## 📐 Methods & Validation

This release implements widely used constructs in endurance-exercise analytics:
- **ACWR**: rolling acute (e.g., 7-day) vs chronic (e.g., 28-day) load ratios with smoothing options.
- **Aerobic Efficiency (EF)**: output (speed/power) relative to effort (heart rate) over time.
- **Cardiovascular Decoupling (pa:hr)**: drift between speed/power and heart rate during steady efforts.

**Important**: ACWR is a descriptive monitoring tool and should be interpreted with caution. It is not a validated injury-prediction model; see discussion in the sports science literature (e.g., DOI: 10.1007/s40279-020-01378-6).

We provide input validation, outlier handling, and activity-level QC filters (e.g., minimal duration, HR plausibility ranges). For cohort summarization, Athlytics computes percentile bands and supports stratification by sport, sex, or other covariates when available.
